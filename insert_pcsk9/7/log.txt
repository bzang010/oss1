Proportion of kmer density right of threshold: 0.579378
[sga correct] Warning: Proportion of kmers greater than the chosen threshold is less than 0.75 (0.579378)
[sga correct] This can indicate your chosen kmer size is too large or your data is too low coverage to reliably correct
[sga correct] It is suggest to lower the kmer size and/or choose the threshold manually
